# Weather Data Batch ETL Pipeline

An end-to-end batch ETL pipeline that extracts weather data from a public API, transforms it into analytics-ready format, and loads it into Snowflake using Apache Airflow.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Apache Airflow
- Snowflake
- AWS S3 (planned)

## Project Goal
Build a production-style batch ETL pipeline demonstrating modern data engineering best practices including orchestration, modular code design, and cloud data warehousing.

## High-Level Architecture
API → Airflow → Raw Storage → Transform → Analytics Tables → Snowflake

## Status
Project in progress.
